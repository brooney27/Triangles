# Triangles

Prompt:
Write a program that allows the user to enter the length of the three sides of a triangle. The program should then display whether the triangle is an equilateral triangle or not. If the triangle is not an equilateral triangle then the program should display if the triangle is a right triangle or not. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other sides for all right triangles.
